# Release Note and Milestone Tracker

## Project Info

**URL**: [Release Note and Milestone Tracker](https://lovable.dev/projects/5c8509ac-9465-49e9-9fa8-cbd2e80eff6c)

This project provides a responsive web app for tracking machine learning model releases, milestones, and their associated metrics. Users can easily track different machine learning modules, input various model details, and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) across versions.

## Project Overview

### **Objective**

This web app is designed to manage and track machine learning model release notes and milestones. It includes multiple machine learning modules and allows users to track specific version details and model performance metrics.

### **Key Features**

Let me know if you want any further adjustments or additional details!

* **Interactive Forms**: Each machine learning module has a dedicated form where users can input important details:

  * Version number
  * Change description
  * Model update flag (if applicable)
  * Model file name
  * Accuracy
  * Architecture (e.g., BERT, CNN)
  * Model metrics: TP, TN, FP, FN
  * Training time per epoch

* **Visual Data Layout**: Display all submitted details in a clean, card-based layout or tabular view. Users can filter data by module and version for easy comparison.

* **Graphical Dashboard**:

  * Visualize version-wise model metrics with bar charts or line charts.
  * Compare model metrics (TP, TN, FP, FN) across different versions.
  * Option to toggle between individual or combined metric views.

* **Custom Module Creation**: Users can create their own machine learning module with pre-defined form templates for the fields mentioned above.

* **UI Design**: The overall design is clean, modern, and visually attractive. Subtle colors and clear data visualizations (including charts, legends, and tooltips) help ensure a great user experience.

### **UI Components**

* **Collapsible Sections**: Modules are organized into collapsible sections for a more organized and less cluttered interface.
* **Data Filters**: Users can filter data based on module and version for easier tracking and comparison.
* **Chart Interactivity**: Users can interact with charts to get detailed insights into specific model metrics across different versions.
